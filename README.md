TATM2012
========

TATM2012 (Those Conversations) is a corpus of naturalistic audio recordings of
people's spontaneous talk as they lean over the balcony of the Turbine Hall,
watching and often discussing the action on the floor below during the
exhibition of artist [Tino Sehgal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_Sehgal)'s piece [These Associations](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-tino-sehgal-2012). It was compiled for a [research project on aesthetics in interaction](http://saulalbert.net/project/accounting-for-taste/) and there is more information about the recordings available on the [TATM2012 project page](http://saulalbert.net/project/those-conversations/).

All audio files are available on the project's archive.org page at [https://archive.org/details/TATM2012](https://archive.org/details/TATM2012):
