TATM2012
========

TATM2012 (Those Conversations) is a corpus of naturalistic audio recordings of
people's spontaneous talk as they lean over the balcony of the Turbine Hall,
watching and often discussing the action on the floor below during the
exhibition of artist [Tino Sehgal]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_Sehgal)'s piece [These Associations](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-tino-sehgal-2012).

All audio files are available on the project's archive.org page at [https://archive.org/details/TATM2012](https://archive.org/details/TATM2012)

### Summary

This is a test repository of Conversation Analytic transcriptions, partly here
to evaluate GitHub as a place to store, share and annotate CA transcripts and
audio source files.
